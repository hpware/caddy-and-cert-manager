# Core Services

This is where my home lab's main cert generation & proxying managing UI (caddy) is being built upon.


## Certificate Management
This system partly follows [RFC8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555), but does not prove ownership of domains. This is designed for home lab users, who want custom certs for their internal services.
