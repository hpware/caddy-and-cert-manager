# Caddy & Cert Manager
> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still in development. There will be bugs.

This platform is what I need for my home lab, a place I could get custom long term certs for my internal services, without the hassle (and security issues) for exposing them to the internet in order to get SSL certs, now you get your own. Bundled with Caddy management for a super basic alternative to [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/).

## Certificate Management
> [!NOTE]
> This system is still not yet implemented!

This system partly follows [RFC8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555), but does not prove ownership of domains. This is designed for home lab users, who want custom certs for their internal services.
